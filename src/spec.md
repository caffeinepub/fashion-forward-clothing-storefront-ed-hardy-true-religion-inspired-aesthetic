# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Infuse a clear “good triumphs over evil” motif across the site’s visuals, key page copy, and seeded catalog while preserving the existing Ed Hardy × True Religion-inspired tattoo/rock + premium denim/western aesthetic.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Home (hero + at least one supporting section) and About page headings/short English copy to explicitly communicate “good triumphs over evil” using existing tone, typography, and styling patterns.
- Extend backend seed catalog data with at least 3 additional on-theme products (names/descriptions in English) and consistent discovery tags, without removing existing items or breaking current filtering/navigation.
- Add new themed static image assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and wire frontend image mapping so new hero/product visuals resolve correctly with fallbacks preserved.

**User-visible outcome:** The Home and About pages clearly communicate the “good triumphs over evil” story in the same visual style, and the catalog includes new discoverable, on-theme products with matching imagery that loads correctly throughout the UI.
