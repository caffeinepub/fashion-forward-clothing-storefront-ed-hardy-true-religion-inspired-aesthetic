  "summary": "Frontend Home and About pages were updated with explicit “good triumphs over evil” themed headings/copy and hero background reference. Backend seed catalog was modified to add themed collections/products. Image path mapping was updated to map new product image keys to generated asset filenames. However, the diff does not show the required new static image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and the backend seed changes do not clearly satisfy the requirement for consistent discovery tags and preserving the existing seed set.",

      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Add the new generated static image assets under frontend/public/assets/generated (hero-banner-triumph.dim_1600x900.png; product-triumph-denim-jacket.dim_1200x1200.png; product-triumph-graphic-tee.dim_1200x1200.png; product-triumph-buckle-belt.dim_1200x1200.png) and ensure they load in the UI.",
      "reason": "The diff shows UI/code references to the new filenames, but no new files were added (ADDED FILES: none), so the required assets are not evidenced as present in the static assets directory.",

      "requirement": "Seed data includes at least 3 themed products with tags that enable discovery via a consistent theme tag (e.g., \"triumph\"/\"light\"/\"angelic\"), without removing existing products from the seed set.",
      "reason": "While themed products were added, the tags shown are not a clearly consistent theme tag set (e.g., tags vary across \"good\", \"evil\", \"angel\", \"balance\", etc.). Also, only six products are shown in the modified seed data, and the requirement explicitly says not to remove existing products from the seed set; the diff does not provide evidence that prior seed products were preserved.",
